This test will start with:

    ./runtest_api.sh

wich will use ng-system as node api.


It should start with

    ./runtest_cli.sh

too .. but not won't work on your system now...
unless `ng-system/bin/` is be in your PATH *and* the script `ng-system/bin/ng-system` script points to your local `ng-system/cli` directory
